What is this? Where am I? Is this real life or is this just phantasy?

The last things I remember were that I was on my daily routine within an IT department when I suddenly regonized a bug in the matrix
with which I erased myself from the `human_entities` table via SQL injection of the architects server.  

Moments later I stood in a room with a pretty cool looking dude called [Neo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_(The_Matrix))
and consumed one of his fancy red pill he was known for dealing with.
Unfortunately the very weak type system got confused and I found myself in the shape of a ... [Herobird](https://github.com/Robbepop)!  

Rumors tell that I escaped the matrix in order to free reality from dirty hacks and bring type systems to rescue.

In the matrix, I was a dude who just (finally) got his Bachelor degree in computer science and was working for a Startup that is crafting
technology around software verification.  
My spare time was sacrifized to subjects such as system programming languages with modern C++ and Rust, crafting compilers, neural networks, general purpose GPU computing and SAT solving.  

Expect to hear from me ... be prepared!
